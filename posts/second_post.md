# Heyy, wassupp ðŸ˜Ž

The concept behind the artwork is

- creating a canvas with two separate parts horizontally, fill backgroundColor with black and add a white circle in the middle of the top part.
- With the one below, add animation using iteration and random.
  z
  So in order to replicate the work, things inside that I need to comprehend:

- random
- iteration
- variables
- frameCount

Then I can dig deeper on p5.js documentation site or youTube, etc.

## RR's sketch

<iframe id="flying_frying" src="https://www.flyingfrying.com/"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`flying_frying`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

**Visual:**
The colors are mainlly white and yellow with a slight shadow to make the egg stand out from the whole white background.
Also, the egg floating on the surface gives some funny feelings when I looked at it.
**Interactivity**
I think mainly in this sketch is about a moving fried egg, so it may serve the function that capture audience's attention when it moves. To make it move in the sketch, random() may be used and it should have the appearance of TAU in the code.

## My sketch

**Interactivity:**
I think it returns from the idea that playing tag, when we were young and naive. helps the audience recall their childhood, everyone once played tag and clearly understood the mechanics of running and chasing.
