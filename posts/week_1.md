# Homework 1a

## For loop

To reflect what I have known so far, to create a grid efficiently using multiple for loops, we might use nested loops for rows and columns. And the provided code creates a rows of pink squares on a turquoise background, in that, each square's size cycles at different rates.

<iframe id="looping" src="https://editor.p5js.org/def-ijk/sketches/1SqvjkvPQ"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`looping`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>
