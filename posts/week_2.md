# Homework 2a

## Cute visuals

One aspect of cuteness that I'm about to utilize is soft color palette. This can create a gentle and dreamy feelings. Iâ€™m the one who is really obsessed with the contrast between blue and orange. However, to make it truly cute, I only use them in light tones like light blue and salmon orange, ensuring they don't look too harsh. This could bring a soft, charming and approachable vibe.

## Cute sounds

To me, cute sound that could be something fitting well to both the visual and interactions, so that might be a popping sound when we click or press something in the canvas.

## Cute interactions

Currently, I've found that interactivity from the cursor is quite interesting and feasible. Therefore, I'm planning to create a creature or element that could play with my cursor. ^.^
