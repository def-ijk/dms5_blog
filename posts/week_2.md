## Cute visuals

One aspect of cuteness that I'm about to utilize is soft color palette. This can create a gentle and dreamy feelings. I’m the one who is really obsessed with the contrast between blue and orange. However, to make it truly cute, I only use them in light tones like light blue and salmon orange, ensuring they don't look too harsh. This could bring a soft, charming and approachable vibe.

## Cute sounds

To me, cute sound that could be something fitting well to both the visual and interactions, so that might be a popping sound when we click or press something in the canvas.

## Cute interactions

Currently, I've found that interactivity from the cursor is quite interesting and feasible. Therefore, I'm planning to create a creature or element that could play with my cursor. ^.^

# Homework 2b

## Describe the kindred spirit for whom your AT1 is an offering.

- My definition about kindred spirit is someone who truly understands me, not just on the surface but at the core. They are my mirror and my anchor, the person who gets my weird jokes, supports my ambitions, and calls me out when I need it.

* What is the context of your kinship
  - We met at a time when we both needed each other—whether it was during school, work, or a random shared experience. Over time, our bond deepened through shared struggles, laughter, and late-night conversations that felt like therapy.
* what is your common purpose?
  - We push each other to be better, to grow, and to create a life that makes us proud. Whether it’s chasing dreams, overcoming self-doubt, or just making it through tough days, we have each other’s backs.
* who or what is your shared challenge / adversary?
  - Our biggest challenge is often ourselves—doubts, fears, and the obstacles life throws at us. But together, we remind each other that we’re stronger than the setbacks, and we keep going no matter what.

## Explain how your chosen kindred spirit may understand or relate to the visual, sonic, and interactive elements of your AT1 idea. 

I’ve already created some sketches depicting underwater life. Visually, both subjects are fish, so depicting an underwater scene would be appropriate for this sketch. I’ve also adjusted the wave steps to make the wave look attractive. Tested multiple times to try the height of the wave, wave speed, and spacing to keep the wave crests.
